# INT-3A3

There were several objectives in this assignment, which built upon the work done in the earlier INT-3A2:<br/>
- Create and hook website into a MySQL database containing information on each picture (i.e. price, description, status [A=available, S=sold], etc.)<br/>
- Verify username/passwords login based on an external username reference file.<br/>
- Add functionality to 'Buy' displayed images, as though shopping on an online gallery.<br/>
- Update MySQL database fields once an image is purchased, and prevent that image from being displayed for sale again.
- When visiting the main page from a specified URL referred source (i.e. www.google.com), refresh the MySQL database to reset all images as Available for purchase (A)<br/>
